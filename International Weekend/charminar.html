	<p> There are many theories attributed to the building of the Charminar. According to one of them, Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah had this monument built in 1591 to express his reverence to Allah. According to another theory, Charminar was built to celebrate the end of plague in the city. Legend also has it that there is a secret tunnel running from this incredible monument to Golconda Fort.

Whatever the reason, one cannot deny that this architecture is elegant, stylish and exquisite. It’s called Charminar because of its four pillars, each of which measure almost 20 meters from the side. They also open to balconies that circle them. These minarets never fail to captivate onlookers and passers-by. Any visit to Hyderabad is incomplete without visiting the Charminar.

Do you know? An amusing sight at the Charminar is that of a cat’s head seated on one of the arches to scare away rats that had once almost destroyed Hyderabad.

Don’t miss: Laad Bazaar is situated in close proximity to the Charminar. You can look for unique artefacts and several food joints in the market itself.

Timings: Charminar is open to tourists from 9:30am to 5:30pm.</p>
