	<h4>Information</h4>

Vijaydurg Fort, dating back to 1205, and constructed during the rule of Raja Bhoj, is the oldest on the Sindhudurg coast. It was earlier called as, Gheria, going by the name of the village, Girye, in which it is located. It was conquered in the year 1653 by Chatrapati Shivaji after defeating the king of Bijapur, Adilshaha. After the fort came into the hands of Shivaji, it was renamed as, <b>Vijaydurg Fort</b>, basing on the name of the Hindu mythological year, Vijay during which it was conquered. The name <b>Vijay</b> means, victory.

When Vijaydurg Fort was first constructed, it occupied a total area of 5 acres and was surrounded by the Arabian Sea on all sides. After few years, when the eastern channel was dugout, roads were constructed on one side providing pedestrian access to the fort. Now the fort is surrounded by the sea on three sides only. During the regime of Chatrapati Shivaji, three great fort walls were constructed increasing the total area of the fort to 17 acres.

According to the history, this fort remains to be one of the two forts in the Maratha kingdom where Shivaji himself used to hoist the saffron coloured flag. This fort is also famously known as, Eastern Gibraltar, as it was almost impenetrable just the great European fort, Gibraltar. This fort had many advantages when it comes to the war front. One such advantage is the 40 km lengthy kharepatan creek containing shallow waters which denied any entrance to the big warships thus protecting the fort from any unprecedented attacks. Shivaji used this fort as a port to anchor and repair Maratha warships. Another advantage of the kharepatan creek was that the warships anchored at the bay were invisible to the naked eye from the far end of the sea.    

Architectural Excellence:

Vijaydurg Fortâ€™s architectural excellence is spellbinding. It houses a 200 m long underwater tunnel which is completely manmade. It has a pinched roof to protect the tunnel from any landslides and is also well ventilated. Today, this tunnel is partially damaged, which if repaired can attract a lot more tourists as well as architecture students.  

Yet another architectural wonder is its compound wall which is constructed 300 ft away from the fort. It runs almost 10 m deep into the sea and serves as a barrier to contain the enemy warships. History has it that many warships met their grave after running into this invisible barrier
