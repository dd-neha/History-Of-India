	<h4>Information</h4>

Kolaba Fort is one of the main tourist attractions in the city of Alibaug located in the district of Raigarh, Maharashtra. On 19th March 1680, Maharaj started building the Kolaba fort. After his death, Sambhaji Maharaj completed the construction of the fort in June 1681. The Kolaba fort later came under the patronage of Sirkeel Kanhoji Angre. At that time, Kolaba fort was the center of strategic activities. Kanhoji Angre died on 4th July 1729 in the fort itself and his dome was also built inside the fort.

In 1729, many constructions inside the fort were destroyed by the fierce fire that took place in one of the bastions. In the second fire in 1787, Angre Wada was destroyed. On November 29, 1721, the British and Portuguese joined forces and attacked the fort with 6,000 soldiers and 3 British ships, but failed to conquer it. The rock on which the fort stands, to its south-east is 267 meters in length, and to the east-west, its width is 109 meters.

The entrance to the fort used to be at the side of the coast, but is now diverted to northeast. Big bangs of stone are just stacked on one another while building this fort. There is no mixture used to combine stones together. Therefore, when the storm surge on the walls of the fort, the water breaks into pieces and reduces the pressure of the waves.

On the entrance of the fort there are carved peacocks, elephants, deer, lily, orphans. Another door of Durga is left as a relic. There are 17 bastions in the fort. Some of the bastions are named as Pagera, Nagarkhani, Ganesh, Sun, Hanuman, Tofakhani, Daruqani among others. In the entrance and on the left side, there is a temple of Bhavani Mata as well as a small temple of Goddess Padmavati.

There is also a famous temple of Lord Siddhivinayak inside the fort. In this temple, Ganesh idol is made of marble and has a height of around half a foot. In the year 1759, Raghoji Angre constructed this Temple. Many tourists and locals visit this temple in huge numbers during Ganesh Chaturthi, festival of Hindu God Ganesha. The gate of the fort is carved with the images of Ganesha, Garuda, Maruti, Magari, Kamal and Velbutti.

For all those tourists who are interested in ancient history and architecture, this fort is a must visit.
