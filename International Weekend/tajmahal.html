	One can go on praising the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with an uninterrupted flow of adjectives – magnificent, outstanding, amazing and incredible. However, none of those can accurately do justice to its beauty. The only way to do that is to visit this incredible structure made of pure white marble. Everything about it reflects grandeur, from its minarets to its dome.

Shah Jahan had this monument built for his wife Mumtaz to express his undying love for her, and today, lovers cite this as an example when expressing their love to each other. The construction of the Taj Mahal, which is also one of the must visit UNESCO World Heritage Sites In India, took around 22 years to complete, and no wonder, the effort of every year is reflected in its construction.

Do you know? Inspired by the Taj Mahal, Dubai is planning to build a hotel and shopping complex which is estimated to be four times larger than the original structure.
