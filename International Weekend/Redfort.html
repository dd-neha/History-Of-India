	<p>Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a symbol of the Mughal Empire at its peak. The enormous size, aesthetic proportions and style, all represent an age of unrestrained opulence. Amidst the unceasing bustle of Old Delhi, stands this colossal monument, evoking nothing but admiration from the onlookers.

Red Fort, which is one of the popular forts and palaces in India, was also built by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan. It took over 10 years to complete, and was constructed when the emperor decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Back then, the fort was known as Qila-e-Mubarak. It is from the ramparts of Red Fort that the Prime Minister delivers his speech on Independence Day.

Do you know? The Red Fort, as you know it, wasn’t always red. In fact, it was white as it was made of limestone. It was the British who painted it red when the limestone began peeling off.

Don’t miss: On your visit to the Red fort, be sure to check out the Palace of Colors, or the “Rang Mahal”. It was the residing place of the emperor’s wives, mistresses and maids.

Timings: 9:30am to 4:30pm daily (closed on Mondays)
